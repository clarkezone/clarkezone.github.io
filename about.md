It all started for me in the 80's with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81 followed with 6502 assembly programming on a BBC  Micro Model B.  Subsequently, as I've been writing code as a hobby and professionally over the past 20+ years, I've primarily been a .NET C# developer with some secondary projects in Javascript and C++.

Since 2014 my interest has been progressively broadening to encompass the "gang of five", these younger c-like upstarts namely Go, Rust, Dart, Kotlin and Swift as well as Modern C++, Python and Julia.  So basically these day's I consider myself less of a .NET guy and more of a poliglot dev.

My day job for the last 8 years or so has involved working at Microsoft on the Windows UI Platform team on the Windows Compositor and this has enabled me to keep my hand in on C# for sample writing.

This blog is in no way connected with my employer and reflects my own opinions.
