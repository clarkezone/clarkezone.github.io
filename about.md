Over the past 20+ years I've been writing code as a hobby and professionally, I've primarily been a .NET C# developer with some secondary projects in Javascript and C++.  Over the last few years my interest has been progressively broadening to encompass the new "gang of five" namely Go, Rust, Dart, Kotlin and Swift as well as Modern C++, Python and Julia.  So basically these day's I consider myself less of a .NET guy and more of a poliglot dev.  My day job working on the Windows UI Platform team enables me to keep my hand in on C#.
