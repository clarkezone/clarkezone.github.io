It all started for me in the 80's with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81 followed with 6502 assembly programming on a BBC  Micro Model B.  Subsequently, as I've been writing code as a hobby and professionally over the past 20+ years, I've primarily been a .NET C# developer [WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, UWP, ASP.NET] with some secondary projects in Javascript and C++.

Since 2014 my interest has been progressively broadening to encompass the "gang of five", these younger c-like upstarts namely Go, Rust, Dart, Kotlin and Swift as well as Modern C++, Python and Julia.  So basically these day's I consider myself less of a .NET guy and more of a poliglot dev.

My day job for the last 8 years or so has involved working at Microsoft on the Windows UI Platform team on the Windows Compositor and this has enabled me to keep my hand in on C# for API tests and sample writing.

Although the day job is all Windows, I personally use a wide variety of platforms including iOS, MacOS, Linux and Android running on Surface, Mac, iPad Pro, Pixel, Google Home, Apple TV, Google Home Hub, Apple Watch, Android Wear, iPhone, XBOX.  As much as possible to try and keep and open mind and stay away from being religious about tech and form opinions based on long term usage.

Finally, this blog is in no way connected with my employer and reflects solely my own opinions and not those of my employer.
