It all started for me in the 80's with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81 followed with 6502 assembly programming on a [BBC Micro Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).  Subsequently, as I've been writing code both as a hobby and professionally over the past 20+ years; up until 2014 I was primarily a .NET C# developer [ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, UWP] with some secondary projects C++ and JavaScript.

Since 2014 my language interests have been progressively broadening to encompass the "gang of five", these younger c-like upstarts namely [Go](https://golang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Swift](https://swift.org/) as well as [Modern C++](https://moderncpp.com/).  So basically these day's I consider myself less of a .NET guy and more of a poliglot language nerd.

I work at Microsoft in Azure these days focussed on distributed systems architecture.  Previously I worked on the Windows Developer platform engineering team.  Out of work hours I've been increasingly interested in Rust as well as the Flutter framework.  There will be content showing up here from all of those strands and others.

I personally use a wide variety of platforms including Windows, iOS, MacOS, Linux and Android running on Surface, Mac, iPad Pro, Pixel, Google Home, Apple TV, Google Home Hub, Apple Watch, Android Wear, iPhone and XBOX.  As much as possible to try and keep and open mind and stay away from being religious about tech and form opinions based on long term usage and inquisitiveness.  Expect to see topics related to all of the above here!

Finally, this blog is in no way connected with  and reflects solely my own opinions and not those of my employer.
