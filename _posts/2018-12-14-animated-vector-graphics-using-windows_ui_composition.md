# Some History: Composition in the Windows DWM
## Give me your bitmaps
TODO: Picture of DWM in Vista composed desktop
Since the mists of time [Windows Vista to be precise], the Desktop Window Manager has been focussed on composing bitmaps.  What does that mean in practice? Well, if you are creating an application that needs display content like a button your application will ultimately need to produce a bitmap representation in order to give to DWM aka the Windows compositor to display on screen.  In reality, UI frameworks take care of this for you so you are probably none the wiser that your lovingly created 
```xaml
<Button/>
```
tag becomes an A8 texture with pre-rendered antialised text and another RGB texture representing the colored rectangle and border.  Furthermore, if your application has a desire to use more exotic XAML shapes, these also need to be rasterized as bitmaps and handed to the Compositor as well.  

## So how do we animate it then?

While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it means that applications and/or UI frameworks have to work harder to animate things.

## Enter Primitives

That was the world of the compositor circa Windows 8.  By Windows 10 RS1, on the compositor team, we had built out the modern Windows.UI.Composition API surface complete with a new set of content and animation primitives and the XAML framework team was able to consume this, bringing simpli

# Native Animated Vector Graphics
## Animated vector all the things
Fast Forward to today: whilst we never got a vector based operating system [TODO wayback link] but we have got a lot of animated vectors:
animated vector graphics have become common place in mobile apps.  It's hard to find a popular mobile app that doesn't have some kind of cute loading screen, welcome animation, app tutorial that doesn't contain a whealth of beautifuly designed characters, dd motion to bring a more playful, human feel. TODO: example GIF.

To be able to support this kind of experience on Windows, We set out on a jouney to add a rich set of vector animation primitives to the engine, staring in RS5 and delivering in a complete end to end implementation in 19H1.  We are releasing both a series of API's that bring low level capabilities to the platform, a toolchain to enable a designer developer workflow from After Effects and a new XAML control that makes it easy for UI developers to incorporate vector animation in apps.  

Becuase the low-level support is implemented in a framework agnostic way in the Compositor itself, it's possible to get animated vector support in UWP XAML Apps, WPF, Winforms and even desktop win32 apps.

## Hello Shape 
For the remainder of this post I will show how to use the low level primitives directly in a desktop win32 project in c++/winrt.  In the next post I'll show how to use some of the higher level tooling to 


 Let's start by creating a basic shape using a ShapeVisual


```c++
void Scenario1SimpleShape(const Compositor & compositor, const ContainerVisual & root) {

	// Create a new ShapeVisual that will contain our drawings
	ShapeVisual shape = compositor.CreateShapeVisual();
	shape.Size({ 100.0f,100.0f });
```

Next we need a gemotry

```c++
	// Create a circle geometry and set it's radius
	auto circleGeometry = compositor.CreateEllipseGeometry();
	circleGeometry.Radius(float2(30, 30));
```

to get the geometry to show up we need to 

```c++
	// Create a shape object from the geometry and give it a color and offset
	auto circleShape = compositor.CreateSpriteShape(circleGeometry);
	circleShape.FillBrush(compositor.CreateColorBrush(Windows::UI::Colors::Orange()));
	circleShape.Offset(float2(50, 50));
```

and finaly get it in the visual tree:

```c++
	// Add the circle to our shape visual
	shape.Shapes().Append(circleShape);

	// Add to the visual tree
	root.Children().InsertAtTop(shape);
```

OK, simple stuff.  Now, how about we create a more interesting composition path using Direct2D.  We need a couple of helpers to achieve this, firstly we are going to use a nice linear gradient as our fill, hence the first helper creates one of those using our compositor.  We're going to use three color stops.

```c++
// Helper funciton to create a GradientBrush
Windows::UI::Composition::CompositionLinearGradientBrush CreateGradientBrush(const Compositor & compositor)
{
	auto gradBrush = compositor.CreateLinearGradientBrush();
	gradBrush.ColorStops().InsertAt(0, compositor.CreateColorGradientStop(0.0f, Windows::UI::Colors::Orange()));
	gradBrush.ColorStops().InsertAt(1, compositor.CreateColorGradientStop(0.5f, Windows::UI::Colors::Yellow()));
	gradBrush.ColorStops().InsertAt(2, compositor.CreateColorGradientStop(1.0f, Windows::UI::Colors::Red()));
	return gradBrush;
}
```

The next helper object contains some boilerplate code needed to convert from an ID2D1Geometry interface to an interop interface called ```IGeometrySource2DInterop``` that is used by CompositionPath in the constructor. 

```c++
// Helper class for converting geometry to a composition compatible geometry source
struct GeoSource final : implements<GeoSource,
	Windows::Graphics::IGeometrySource2D,
	ABI::Windows::Graphics::IGeometrySource2DInterop>
{
public:
	GeoSource(com_ptr<ID2D1Geometry> const & pGeometry) :
		_cpGeometry(pGeometry)
	{ }

	IFACEMETHODIMP GetGeometry(ID2D1Geometry** value) override
	{
		_cpGeometry.copy_to(value);
		return S_OK;
	}

	IFACEMETHODIMP TryGetGeometryUsingFactory(ID2D1Factory*, ID2D1Geometry** result) override
	{
		*result = nullptr;
		return E_NOTIMPL;
	}

private:
	com_ptr<ID2D1Geometry> _cpGeometry;
};

```

So, let's use those two helpers to create a simple path using Direct2D.  The ShapeVisual configuration is the same as in the first example.

```c++
void Scenario2SimplePath(const Compositor & compositor, const ContainerVisual & root) {
	// Same steps as for SimpleShapeImperative_Click to create, size and host a ShapeVisual
	ShapeVisual shape = compositor.CreateShapeVisual();
	shape.Size({ 500.0f, 500.0f });
	shape.Offset({ 300.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f });
```

For this example, we are going to use a ```ID2D1GeometrySink``` to build up the actual path.  So we need to create a couple of objects that allow us to get back

```c++
	// Create a D2D Factory
	com_ptr<ID2D1Factory> d2dFactory;
	check_hresult(D2D1CreateFactory(D2D1_FACTORY_TYPE_SINGLE_THREADED, d2dFactory.put()));

	com_ptr<GeoSource> result;
	com_ptr<ID2D1PathGeometry> path;

	// use D2D factory to create a path geometry
	check_hresult(d2dFactory->CreatePathGeometry(path.put()));

	// for the path created above, create a Geometry Sink used to add points to the path
	com_ptr<ID2D1GeometrySink> sink;
	check_hresult(path->Open(sink.put()));

	// Add points to the path
	sink->SetFillMode(D2D1_FILL_MODE_WINDING);
	sink->BeginFigure({ 1, 1 }, D2D1_FIGURE_BEGIN_FILLED);
	sink->AddLine({ 300, 300 });
	sink->AddLine({ 1, 300 });
	sink->EndFigure(D2D1_FIGURE_END_CLOSED);
	
	// Close geometry sink
	check_hresult(sink->Close());

	// Create a GeoSource helper object wrapping the path
	result.attach(new GeoSource(path));
	CompositionPath trianglePath = CompositionPath(result.as<Windows::Graphics::IGeometrySource2D>());

	// create a CompositionPathGeometry from the composition path
	CompositionPathGeometry compositionPathGeometry = compositor.CreatePathGeometry(trianglePath);

	// create a SpriteShape from the CompositionPathGeometry, give it a gradient fill and add to our ShapeVisual
	CompositionSpriteShape spriteShape = compositor.CreateSpriteShape(compositionPathGeometry);
	spriteShape.FillBrush(CreateGradientBrush(compositor));

	// Add the SpriteShape to our shape visual
	shape.Shapes().Append(spriteShape);

	// Add to the visual tree
	root.Children().InsertAtTop(shape);
}
```

More stuff at the end.  And more.  And this is autoupdated.  And again. dd. aa.ss


WinRT is much better than cx becuase it's faster.  Finally we have the daemon running.
Fun can be had.
