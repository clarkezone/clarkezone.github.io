#Some History: Bitmap Composition in Windows#
Since the mists of time [Windows Vista to be precise], the Desktop Window Manager has been focussed on composing bitmaps.  What does that mean in practice? Well, if you are creating an application that needs display content like a button your application will ultimately need to produce a bitmap representation in order to give to DWM aka the Windows compositor to display on screen.  In reality, UI frameworks take care of this for you so you are probably none the wiser that your lovingly created 
```xaml
<Button/>
```
tag becomes an A8 texture with pre-rendered antialised text and another RGB texture representing the colored rectangle and border.  Furthermore, if your application has a desire to use more exotic XAML shapes, these also need to be rasterized as bitmaps and handed to the Compositor as well.  While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it means that applications and/or UI frameworks have to work harder to animate things.

That was the world of the compositor circa Windows 8.  In Windows 8.1 we had desires to start moving beyond bitmaps.  The reason back then was to fix the Airspace issue that existed with XAML and Webview.  But we also had a desire to push forward and expand the capabilites of the compositor to offer frameworks and apps a way richer palette of graphical primitives.  By Windows 10 RS1 we had built out the modern Windows.UI.Composition API surface and moved XAML completely on top of it for basic rendering.  Text is to this day still rendered to A8 textures but buttons, rectangles, borders etc use the corresponding composition primitives.

#Native Animated Vector Graphics
Fast Forward to today: animated vector graphics have become common place in mobile apps.  It's hard to find a popular mobile app that doesn't have some kind of cute loading screen, welcome animation, app tutorial that doesn't contain a whealth of beautifuly designed characters, dd motion to bring a more playful, human feel. TODO: example GIF.

That brings me to Windows 10 19H1.  We are releasing both a series of API's that bring 

##Hello Shape 
In this example I'm going to use a desktop win32 project in c++/winrt to show off the capabilites.  I also have c# examples available here.  Let's start by creating a basic shape using a ShapeVisual


```cppwinrt
void Scenario1SimpleShape(const Compositor & compositor, const ContainerVisual & root) {

	// Create a new ShapeVisual that will contain our drawings
	ShapeVisual shape = compositor.CreateShapeVisual();
	shape.Size({ 100.0f,100.0f });
```

Next we need a gemotry

```cppwinrt
	// Create a circle geometry and set it's radius
	auto circleGeometry = compositor.CreateEllipseGeometry();
	circleGeometry.Radius(float2(30, 30));
```

to get the geometry to show up we need to 

```cppwinrt
	// Create a shape object from the geometry and give it a color and offset
	auto circleShape = compositor.CreateSpriteShape(circleGeometry);
	circleShape.FillBrush(compositor.CreateColorBrush(Windows::UI::Colors::Orange()));
	circleShape.Offset(float2(50, 50));
```

and finaly get it in the visual tree:

```cppwinrt
	// Add the circle to our shape visual
	shape.Shapes().Append(circleShape);

	// Add to the visual tree
	root.Children().InsertAtTop(shape);
```


- Creating Window
- Adding visuals
- Hello ShapeVisual
- PathGeometry, CompositionPathâ€™s and CompositionSpriteShapes
- Animating PathGeometry
- Lottie: pre-canned animations
- Lottie: full authoring pipeline

More stuff at the end.  And more.  And this is autoupdated.  And again. dd. aa.ss


WinRT is much better than cx becuase it's faster.  Finally we have the daemon running.
Fun can be had.
