One of the features that the Composition team have recently added is support for animated vector graphics.  What I'm pretty happy about with our support is that we've added, not only the primitives in the compositor, but also complete tooolchain and playback support truly lighting up end-to-end.  Another exciting aspect is that this works in all Microsoft frameworks and UI targets including UWP XAML, WPF, Winforms and raw win32 c++ apps.
