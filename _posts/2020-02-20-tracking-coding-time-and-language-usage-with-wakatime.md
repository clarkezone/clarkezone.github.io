One of the themes that has resonated with me aver the past three years is language innovation.  I shipped my first commercial product for root6 using a beta version of .NET 1.0 before the go-live license kicked in.. i fell in love with c# and a 20? year cares arc ensued.

Three years ago I started dabbling with GoLang for server-side code and experienced a similar if not as intese sense of possibilites.  The something weird happend.. had the same experience withKotlin at Google IO 200?, then Swift, then Modern C++, then Rust and most recently Dart.  My experience at the awesome rustconf last October also reinforced and reminded me about how the communities around languages are arguably as importanf / energizing as thr tech itself.

With my ballooning polyglotness on the rise ive been working on a much more diverse range of projects both open and closed source. and being a nerd, I began wondering where my time was going.  Looking around, seemed that Wakatime could provide an answer
