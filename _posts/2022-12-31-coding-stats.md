I’m writing this post on the last day of 2022.  So first off, thanks for staying subscribed and a very happy holidays and Happy New Year to you all!

Turns out I haven’t posted here in over two and a half years, which I’m not super happy with.  There are various reasons which I’ll get into in subsequent updates, but wanted to ease back into things with a quick end of year wrap up.  Despite this lack of blogging activity and a reduction in social media engagement in general, I have actually been doing a lot of learning and coding so I thought I’d dust this thing off and start by taking a look back at my coding activity for the last year using a tool I’ve been using called Wakatime.

## Wakatime

Wakatime integrates with most popular editors and IDEs and tracks coding activity on a fairly granular basis.
