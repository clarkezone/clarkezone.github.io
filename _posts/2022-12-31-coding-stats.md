I’m writing this post on my phone while backstage at Seatle Symphony on the last night of 2022. I'm here to sing tenor in the chorus in Beethoven's 9th symphony which we're doing as part of the New Year concert.  So first off, thanks for staying subscribed and a very happy holidays and Happy New Year to all of you!  One of my New Year resolutions for 2021 was to start blogging again which clearly didn't go so well :-)  Hope you've had better luck with yours.

For various reasons, I haven’t posted on this blog in over two and a half years.  This is a particular #fail as I had set myself a goal to start blogging again in 2021, and here we are at 11:30pm on New Years eve! Despite a lack of blogging activity, I have actually been learning and coding quite a bit so I thought I'd ease back into posting to taking a look at my coding activity for the last year.

How much codibg did you do this yesr?  Do you know what yiu eorjed on?  Did you have anybparticular goals you were aining for?  Did you neet them?

Part of why I thought I'd start here is because on New Year's we get all of those "here's your stats from the last year emails and I happened to get one of those from Wakatime. I use Wakatime to track my coding activity; I like it because it integrates with most popular editors I use and tracks activity on a fairly granular basis so I can get a breakdown of editors, languages projects etc.
