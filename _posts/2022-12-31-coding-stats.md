I’m writing this post on my phone on the last night of 2022 backstage at Seatle Symphony. I'm here to sing tenor in the chorus in Beethoven's 9th symphony which we're doing as part of the New Year concert.  So first off, thanks for staying subscribed and a very happy holidays and Happy New Year to all of you!

Turns out I haven’t posted on this blog in over two and a half years.  There are various reasons which I’ll get into in subsequent updates, but wanted to ease back into things with a quick end of year wrap up as 'tis the season for that such things.  Despite a lack of blogging activity and a reduction in social media engagement, I have actually been learning and coding so I thought I’d dust this thing off by taking a look back at my coding activity for 2022.

## Wakatime

I use Wakatime to track my coding activity; I like it because it integrates with most popular editors I use and tracks activity on a fairly granular basis so I can get a breakdown of editors, languages projects etc.
