I've been playing with gRPC and microservice recently (more on that later) and one aspect that I've needed to figure out as part of that particular adventure has been getting gRPC endpoint running over SSL.  To do that, I turned to Let's Encrypt ss

Figuring out how to do this on github pages.

```cs
class test {
    string hello;
}
```

**Also looking at editing workflows**

Working Copy and 1writer seems like a pretty great combo.  Amazing. Bla bla ddd ppppjjjjdddddddd
