I regularly perform clean installations on my Mac, PC, and Linux machines. To track how the initial setup process evolves over time, I'm documenting my installation steps. This serves as both a personal reference and a potentially useful guide for others.  In this first post I'm covering MacOS which I'll follow next with the Windows version.  I hope you find something useful here.

## Core Productivity Tools
All of these are pri 0 essential and hence are my first installs.  Apart from Tailscale, these all come from the Mac App Store.

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://tailscale.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Tailscale"><br>[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) | A zero-config VPN for building secure networks, connecting your devices and securing your services without the hassle of traditional VPNs. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Tailscale is the first install for me on all devices as it's how all my devices connect to each other and to private services I self host at home. Although available in the Mac App Store, that version has [various limitations](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants) and hence I do a standalone install.|N|
| 2 | <img src="https://bitwarden.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Bitwarden"><br>[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) | A secure open-source password manager that helps you store, generate, and autofill passwords across all your devices. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** My preferred password manager. I self-host the server and connect to it via the Tailscale tailnet.  Makes logging in to the remaining apps a breaze.|Y|
| 3 | <img src="https://www.craft.do/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Craft"><br>[Craft](https://www.craft.do) | A beautiful and powerful document editor that helps you organize your thoughts, projects, and ideas with rich formatting options. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I am a HUGE fan of Craft going back a number of years.  I find myself using it more and more for an expanding set of tasks including knowledge management, planning, daily task tracking and more. This would be the one app I would take with me to a desert island.|Y|
| 4 | <img src="https://flexibits.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Fantastical"><br>[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com) | A powerful calendar app with natural language processing, allowing you to quickly add events and manage your schedule. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Fantastical is a perfect solution for my needs. Seamless handling of multiple services and calendars e.g. from iCloud and Google calendar, and natural language input for events.  It's on all of my Apple devices as syncs perfectly.  I love the native UI and flexibility around how calendars can be grouped.  Fantastical recently came out for Windows and is on my list to try there. |Y|
| 5 | <img src="https://dayoneapp.com/wp-content/themes/day-one-app/assets/img/day-one-app-logo.svg"  alt="Day One"><br>[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) | A journaling app that helps you record your life with text, photos, and location data in a beautiful interface. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Preferred diarying solution currently, although since acquisition by WordPress I am starting to think about evaluating new solutions. |Y|

## Core Development GUI Tools
After getting the bare esentials installed, next up it is my primary workload: software development.

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://zed.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flogo_icon.d67dc948.webp&w=32&q=100" width="64" alt="Zed"><br>[Zed](https://zed.dev/) | A high-performance, collaborative code editor designed for speed and modern collaboration. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Even though it's early in the development timeline I love Zed because its a modern editor written in Rust using native UI and hence is lightning fast.  It's being developed by Nathan Sobo and some of the folks who did the [Atom code editor](https://atom-editor.cc) as well as folks like Max Brunsfeld who did [Tree Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).  Zed is evolving rapidly and I have no doubt it will continue to gain adoption and popularity. |N|
| 2 | <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/xcode-12/xcode-12-96x96_2x.png" width="64" alt="Xcode"><br>[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com) | Apple's integrated development environment for creating apps for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** The more I use XCode the more I like it even though it took a lot of getting used to initially when coming from Visual Studio. |Y|
| 3 | <img src="https://ghostty.org/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Ghostty"><br>[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) | A fast, feature-rich terminal emulator designed for developers with modern UI elements. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I came across Ghostty as part of a recent quest to learn the Zig programming language.  It was written by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) of Hashicorp fame and it [lives up to the promise of being fast and feature rich](https://ghostty.org/docs/about). Certainly significantly better Mac option than Alacritty in my experience. |N|
| 4 | <img src="https://ghostty.org/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Ghost remote"><br>Ghost remote | Terminal connection utility using the command: `infocmp -x | ssh YOUR-SERVER -- tic -x -` **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Needed to support Linux servers correctly. |N|
| 5 | <img src="https://wakatime.com/apple-touch-icon.png" width="64" alt="Wakatime"><br>[Wakatime for Mac](https://wakatime.com) | An automatic time tracking tool that measures your programming activity across different editors and projects. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Wakatime integrates with all of my code editors including NeoVim to give me stats on how long I spend working on different projects. |N|
| 6 | <img src="https://lmstudio.ai/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="LM Studio"><br>[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | A desktop app for running and experimenting with large language models locally on your device. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** LM Studio is a tool for running open source AI models locally which is a good way of experimenting with the rapidly evolving space.  Many similar solutions are popping up in different places [like VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEXCCuaV2gc&t=1s).  I like LM Studio because it uses [Apple's MLX framework](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/mlx-engine) to leverage the full hardware acceleration of Apple Silicon, also rapid development. |N|
| 7 | <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="VSCode"><br>[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) | Microsoft's powerful code editor with support for debugging, syntax highlighting, and thousands of extensions. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** VS Code is required for any modern dev environment.  I'm not a fan of [electron-based](https://www.electronjs.org) software in general but have to make an exception here. VS Code is a solid choice with broad support for every language and environment. |N|

## Core Development CLI Tools
A lot of development work happens on the CLI and getting a good CLI environment is paramount.  This is what I use in the order of install priority.

| Install Order | Tool | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://atuin.sh/_astro/atuin.4e0ff728.png" width="64" alt="Atuin"><br>[atuin](https://atuin.sh) | A magical shell history that synchronizes across all your machines. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** For those of us who use CLI history as a way of saving time and, for example, recalling those obscure parameters previously used to start a container, `ctrl-r` is muscle memory.  Atuin is a big step up from bash or zsh's default ctrl-r menu, for example it stores and can recall history for the session or a particular directory and has some neat stats visualizations. The searching and filtering is also a big step up.  Finally the really big one: it solves a major pain point with using multiple dev-boxes by enabling syncing between machines either via an encrypted cloud service or a selfhostable version. |N|
| 2 | <img src="https://brew.sh/assets/img/homebrew-256x256.png" width="64" alt="Homebrew"><br>[brew](https://brew.sh) | The missing package manager for macOS, allowing easy installation of software and tools. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Brew is mandatory for development on MacOS. |N|
| 3 | <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" width="64" alt="GitHub CLI"><br>[gh](https://cli.github.com) | GitHub's official command-line tool to interact with GitHub repositories from the terminal. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** gh is the best way to interact with GitHub from the CLI. Even better with the CLI completions installed to easily complete eg repo names etc. |N|
| 4 | <img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Logo-2Color.png" width="64" alt="Git"><br>[git](https://git-scm.com) | Distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during development. |N|
| 5 | git completions | Command-line completions for git commands for faster workflow. |N|
| 6 | gh completions | Command-line completions for GitHub CLI commands. |N|
| 7 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/podman/main/logo/podman-logo.png" width="64" alt="Podman"><br>[podman](https://podman.io) | A daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Podman is plug compatible with docker in most all scenarios I've come across, is generally better and not encumbered by restrictive licensing terms. |N|
| 8 | podman completions | Command-line completions for Podman commands. |N|
| 9 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/logo/logo.png" width="64" alt="Kubernetes"><br>[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) | Command-line tool for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Since my home infra uses self-hosted Kubernetes clusters and I'm CLI first, I need this. |N|
| 10 | kubectl completions | Command-line completions for Kubernetes commands. |N|
| 11 | Kubeconfig for production Kube clusters | Configuration file for accessing the Kubernetes cluster4. |N|
| 12 | NAS | Access configuration for NASMKii storage system. |N|
| 13 | SSH key for Linux devbox | SSH authentication keys for accessing the devbox. |N|

## Video Production & Creative

My second major use case, after programming, is tools for video and audio production.  Many of these are specialist and relate to specific hardware I use in my studio hence I won't go into details here (if you are interested feel free to reach out).

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://pro-cdn.pixelmator.com/web-assets/app-icons/navigation/icon_pro-2.0--v6.png" width="64" alt="Pixelmator"><br>[Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com) | A powerful, full-featured image editor with tools for enhancing photos, drawing, and creating graphic designs. **CLARKEZONE TAKE** I use Photoshop a lot less as a result of how good PM is. Apple liked it so much they bought the company.|Y|
| 2 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Blackmagic ATEM"><br>Blackmagic Cloud Store Setup | Cloud collaboration tools for DaVinci Resolve projects, allowing teams to work together remotely. |N|
| 3 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Blackmagic ATEM"><br>Blackmagic Converters | Blackmagic Design's software for configuring video conversion hardware. |N|
| 4 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Blackmagic ATEM"><br>Blackmagic Hyperdeck | Control software for Blackmagic Design's HyperDeck video recorders. |N|
| 5 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Blackmagic ATEM"><br>Blackmagic Desktop Video | Blackmagic Design's software for configuring capture and playback devices. |N|
| 6 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Blackmagic ATEM"><br>[Blackmagic Atem software control](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atemproduction) | Control software for Blackmagic Design's ATEM video switchers. |N|
| 7 | <img src="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="DaVinci Resolve"><br>[Resolve Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) | Professional video editing, color correction, visual effects, and audio post-production software. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Resolve has firmly replaced Premier Pro for me at this point, and I can't see that changing.  One time purchase, blazing performance, broad and deep capabilities, iPad support, amazing color grading and audio.  The list goes on and on.  And it integrates seamlessly with the reset of my workflow which is increasingly Blackmagic centric. |N|
| 9 | <img src="https://www.midasconsoles.com/.resources/musictribe-templates/webresources/logos/header-logo-midas.svg" width="64" alt="Midas M32"><br>[Midas M32 edit](https://www.midasconsoles.com/product.html?modelCode=P0B3I) | Control software for the Midas M32 digital mixing console. |N|
| 10 | [Dante controller](https://www.audinate.com/products/software/dante-controller) | Network configuration and routing software for Dante audio networking. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I moved add my machines to Dante audio feeding a 32 channel Midas M32c.  The mixer just has a network jack, gets inputs over the network from Dante USB and virtual soundcards attached to every device.  Output is over the network to discrete speakers.  With this setup I can route the mix anywhere it is needed for recording, streaming or listening and do fancy things like reversible Dolby 5.1 speaker configurations that works either from my desk or from the couch at the other end of the room. |N|

| 14 | <img src="https://rive.app/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Rive"><br>[Rive](https://rive.app) | Create interactive animations for apps, games, and websites. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Rive is so interesting that it really merits it's own post. A 2D animation tool and runtime that is gaining both capabilities and market acceptance at a dizzying rate. |Y|

## Content

Tools for consuming media.

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://macautomationtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kindle-icon-png-28.jpg.png" width="64" alt="Kindle"><br>[Kindle for MacOS](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp) | Amazon's e-reader app giving access to millions of books, magazines, and documents. |Y|
| 2 | <img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex026/uploads/firecore/original/3X/4/6/46ffd8cb3893cfaffeb5d66c3a5ced7ecc2cd37b.png" width="64" alt="Infuse"><br>[Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) | A beautiful media player that organizes and plays video files from various sources. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I switched to InFuse from Plex in early 2024 because InFuse doesn't need a server for metadata, just access to the media.  Metadata is sync'd via iCloud.  Since I exclusively consume content on AppleTV, this is fine, if you need x-plat access this won't be an option. I also like it as it plays nicely with Apple's audio routing to enable me to extract Dolby 5.1 surround into my Dante mixer. |Y|

## Additional Development Tools

These tools typically get installed on an as needed basis depending on what I'm doing and what I need.  Some of them I'm still experimenting with.

| 1 | <img src="https://neovim.io/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="NeoVim"><br>[NeoVim](https://neovim.io) | Hyperextensible Vim-based text editor focused on extensibility and usability. **Clarkezone Take:** VIM is the best terminal based editor (clearly :-)) and Neovim is the modern evolving offshoot of this classic with great extensibility via [lua]([https://www.lua.org](https://www.lua.org)). My config uses [Lazy](https://lazy.folke.io) and can be found [here.](https://github.com/clarkezone/neovimconfig/tree/lazyport) I love [the Primagen's hilarious YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@thevimeagen?si=vjynJNCEYKynPSUs) about the merits of VIM. |N|

It is syntax compatible with Python but offers static typing, compilation to native binaries, memory safety and supports not only CPU but also targets such as GPU, NPU. It is interesting to me because it eliminates the need for models to have a mix of Python (for ease of development and iteration), C++ (for deploying performance-critical kernels) and CUDA for targeting GPUs. |N|
