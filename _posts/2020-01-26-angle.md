For reasons that I'll cover in a future post, I've been experimenting with [LibAngle](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle) of late.  Angle, otherwise known as Almost Native Graphics Layer, is a translation layer that emulates OpenGL calls on top of various graphics backends such as DirectX, Vulcan etc.  From the repo description:

> The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to seamlessly run WebGL and other OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL ES API calls to one of the hardware-supported APIs available for that platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 to Vulkan, desktop OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D 11. Future plans include ES 3.2, translation to Metal and MacOS, Chrome OS, and Fuchsia support.

Microsoft is an official contributor to the project and back in 2018, I submitted a patch to add [`Windows.UI.Composition`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Composition) support as a type of "nativewindow" to enable Angle content to be hosted on Windows using a [`SpriteVisual`]() instead of an HWND or CoreWindow.

[![Angle Patch](/static/img/angle-1-26-2020/gerrit.png)](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/1236844)

I was keen to submit this upstream as the [Microsoft fork](https://github.com/microsoft/angle/commits/ms-master) of Angle has got pretty stale at this point and is not actively maintained as far as I can tell.

### Why?
The reasoning for this change is explained in more detail in the [writeup I did supporing the patch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggv6H-aK1a3pXNMTtMF6h0Bv0rulIeBpBxBBCJYR6Zs/edit) but can be summarized as follows:

An increasing number of WinRT API's work in both a Win32 full trust context as well as in AppContainer partial trust environments such as a UWP application.  The benefit to developers is they can reuse the same code in either WIN32 or UWP contexts by leveraging `SpriteVisual` hosting as a converged approach.  This will become more seemless over time as the team realizes the [vision of unification of UWP and Win32](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/81330?source=sessions) but can still be very beneficial in todays world.

By enabling `Windows.UI.Composition.SpriteVisual` to be used as a hosting mechanism, it is  possible to build a renderer using OpenGL and have it work everywhere on Windows: a native win32 app (User32, Winforms, WPF), Win32 XAML islands and UWP.

### Completing the work
Although my initial change worked, there was an issue with the mechanism used to detect if the feature is available on a particular OS version []

TODO what else?

Here is the branch with the final changes [https://github.com/clarkezone/angle/tree/UniversalCompositorNativeWindow](https://github.com/clarkezone/angle/tree/UniversalCompositorNativeWindow)

and the diff to make things work:

### The Test Project
To prove that we could indeed have a converged rendering implementation that could be deployed to / shared between a number of environments, I build the following test project:

TODO: screenthow

The hosting code looks like this for Win32

```c++
auto foo = new Bar();
```

```c++
auto foo = new Bar();
```
