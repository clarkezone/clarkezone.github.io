For reasons that I'll cover in a future post, I've been experimenting with [LibAngle](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle) of late.  Angle, otherwise known as Almost Native Graphics Layer, is a translation layer that emulates OpenGL calls on top of various graphics backends such as DirectX, Vulcan etc.  From the repo description:

> The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to seamlessly run WebGL and other OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL ES API calls to one of the hardware-supported APIs available for that platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 to Vulkan, desktop OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D 11. Future plans include ES 3.2, translation to Metal and MacOS, Chrome OS, and Fuchsia support.

Microsoft is an official contributor and back in TODO, I submitted a patch to add Windows.UI.Composition support as a type of "nativewindow".
