My git blog is powered by Jekyll, a static site generator.  Because I've been using the iPad for content creation, I've found it quite hard to get previews of blog.  Why do I need a preview you may ask?  Well, things like having the Jekyll template applied, seeing the layout, embeds etc often need iteration and tweaking.  And, in order for preview to be useful, I have the following requirements:

1) Preview any branch
2) Preview before the post is live
3) Preview can run in the cloud so I can call if from the iPad

To meet the above requirements
