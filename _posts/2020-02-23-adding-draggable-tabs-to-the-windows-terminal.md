I'm a massive fan of the work the team's been doing on [](WSL and the new Windows Terminal) and am a complete convert.. muscle memory on Windows is now term not `cmd` or `PowerShell`.  One minor frustration I was having with it was the inability to reorder tabs.  Whist at Ignite I had a bit of downtime between manning the WinUI booth and decided to take a crack at solving.  Turns out it was pretty easy.
