Since this blog is primarily tech focussed, the about section is about tech and me.

Programming started for me age 8 back in the 80’s with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81 followed with 6502 assembly programming on a [BBC Micro Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).  Subsequently, as I’ve been writing code as both a hobby and professionally over the past 20+ years. Up until 2014 I identified primarily a .NET C# developer [ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, UWP] with some secondary interest and projects C++ and JavaScript.

Since 2014 my language interests have been progressively broadening to encompass a more polyglot stance with [Go](https://golang.org/), [Swift](https://swift.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Zig]() and Mojo.  In 2019/2022 I did a concentrated stint with [Modern C++](https://moderncpp.com/).  At the moment, for personal projects, I'm mainly using Swift and SwiftUI.

Computing wise, I use a wide variety of platforms including Windows, iOS, MacOS, Linux, Android running on devices including iPhone, iPad Pro, Surface, Mac, Solana Saga, Raspberry Pi, Apple TV, Google Home Hub, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, and Mac Studio.  As much as possible to try and keep and open mind and stay away from being religious about platforms, OS's and tech in general forming opinions based on long term usage and inquisitiveness.  Expect to see topics related to all of the above here on this blog.
