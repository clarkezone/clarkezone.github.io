Programming started for me age 8 back in the 80’s with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81 followed with 6502 assembly programming on a [BBC Micro Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro).  Subsequently, as I’ve been writing code as both a hobby and professionally over the past 20+ years. Up until 2014 I identified primarily a .NET C# developer [ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, UWP] with some secondary interest and projects C++ and JavaScript.

Since 2014 my language interests have been progressively broadening to encompass a more polyglot stance with [Go](https://golang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and to a lesser extent [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Swift](https://swift.org/).  In 2019/2022 I did a concentrated stint with [Modern C++](https://moderncpp.com/).  For the last couple of years I’ve mainly been reading and writing GoLang (and YAML manifests :-))

I work at Microsoft in Azure these days focussed on the distributed systems and cloud native domains.  Prior to that, I worked on the Windows Developer platform engineering team from 2008-2020 and got to work on Windows 8, 8.1, and all flavors of Windows 10.  Area of focus was the modern Windows UI stack.

Tech wise, I use a wide variety of platforms including Windows, iOS, MacOS, Linux and Android running on Surface, Mac, iPad Pro, Solana Saga, Raspberry Pi, Google Home, Apple TV, Google Home Hub, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, iPhone, and XBOX.  As much as possible to try and keep and open mind and stay away from being religious about tech and form opinions based on long term usage and inquisitiveness.  Expect to see topics related to all of the above here!

Finally, this blog is in no way connected with Microsoft and reflects solely my own opinions and not those of my employer.
